# Workout Tracker using MERN Stack  

## Overview  

This project is a **Workout Tracker Application** built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**. It provides a seamless and **real-time workout management system** for users and trainers. The application allows users to track workouts, maintain workout histories, and receive feedback from trainers. **JWT-based authentication** ensures secure user data management, while middleware improves security and error handling. Below is an overview of the analysis, along with sample outputs and results. This project was done in Nov' 2024.
